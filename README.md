##SUMMARY :
**_The source of many software failures is complexity.
Then you take each piece of the feature and make it even more complex, and the task will take nine months.
Then you start to introduce many new bugs because of the complexity in your code.
At the end, when even small changes become hard.
As a developer, your first behavior should be resistance to unnecessary change._**
